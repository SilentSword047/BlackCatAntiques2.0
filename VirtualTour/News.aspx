        <h2>UNDER CONSTRUCTION SALE!</h2>
        <h2>10% OFF ALMOST EVERYTHING!</h2>
        <h3>Posted: June 8, 2018</h3>

        <p class="paragraph">The sidewalks on the north side of Frederica St. W. are being replaced from Brown to Edward. We are expecting it to take 6 weeks, 
    so may last until the middle of July! Traffic is now one lane Eastbound only with parking on the south side of the street. 
    We are offering 10% off on almost everything in the Store while the construction is under way! Accessibility is good, 
    but check with us if mobility is a concern. Be sure to like and follow us for our upcoming Multi Estate Sale featuring 3 Estates, 
    2 down sizings and 2 business closures towards the end of June!</p>
